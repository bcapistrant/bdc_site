I am a social epidemiologist interested in social determinants of chronic diseases and aging in both the U.S. and in low and middle income countries.  

My work focuses on two main areas of inquiry: 

1. prevalence and distribution of cardiovascular disease, physical and cognitive function that generate care needs among older adults; and 

2. who provides social support, including caregiving, to family members with care needs and how does that support affect the caregiverâ€™s health.

I also consider how these patterns and associations may vary by social factors such as race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status.

Examples of completed work in these areas can be found on [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Capistrant%2C%20Benjamin%5BAuthor%5D) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&pli=1&user=987QJWYAAAAJ).
