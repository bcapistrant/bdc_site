# Biography

I am a social and population health scientist, and my research and teaching span multiple disciplines: social work, gerontology, statistics and data science, epidemiology, health policy, and demography.

I attempt to characterize: 1. how families provides support, including caregiving, for a family member with care needs and 2. how that support affects the caregiver's health. My work also focuses on population aging, prevalence and distribution of health conditions that drive care needs in later life. Recently, this work has focused on the mental health and well-being of sexual and gender minority adults in middle and older-age. My policy work has included modeling population aging for state-level Medicaid long-term supports and services planning and program evaluation capacity building among community based organizations working toward value-based payment models for Medicaid reimbursement for their work.
