<p>I am a social epidemiologist interested in social determinants of chronic diseases and aging in both the U.S. and in low and middle income countries.</p>
<p>My work focuses on two main areas of inquiry:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>prevalence and distribution of cardiovascular disease, physical and cognitive function that generate care needs among older adults; and</p></li>
<li><p>who provides social support, including caregiving, to family members with care needs and how does that support affect the caregiverâ€™s health.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I also consider how these patterns and associations may vary by social factors such as race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>Examples of completed work in these areas can be found on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Capistrant%2C%20Benjamin%5BAuthor%5D">PubMed</a> or <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;pli=1&amp;user=987QJWYAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>.</p>
